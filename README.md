# prism
AI-powered GitHub Action for smarter open-source triage. PRism detects duplicate issues and PRs, generates structured PR review summaries, applies intelligent labels, and optionally supports Postgres + pgvector for persistent similarity. Runs fully inside GitHub Actions, stateless by default, with optional stateful mode for large repos.
